    "    The objective: \"Make sure that existing iRODS groups are not deleted based on the removal of LDAP group\" makes me wonder under which conditions an iRODS group is deleted? While I understand that you do not want to remove a group as soon as it is empty, I do not think that it makes sense to keep it forever also. It seems reasonable to me to define a default expiration time for empty groups, for example six months. If the group has data, we could apply the same procedure proposed for a user with data.\n",
